# React-Xs-and-Os
This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The goal of this project was to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for users, allowing them to play either against another player or against the computer.

Key Features
Game Modes: Choose between two-player mode or one-player mode against a computer opponent.
Scoring System: Keep track of wins, losses, and ties for both single-player and two-player modes.
Responsive Design: The game is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on various devices.
Visual Enhancements: The game includes visual enhancements such as rainbow buttons and glowing effects for a more engaging interface.

Why This Project Is Important
1. Educational Purpose: This project serves as a practical application of React concepts and state management. In particular it focuses on the interplay between turn based actions which must be performed synchronously with the asynchronous nature of React.

2. User Interaction and Experience: The project focuses on providing an enjoyable user experience, implementing features like glowing buttons and dynamic score updates to enhance user engagement.

3. Flexibility: The inclusion of both single-player and two-player modes caters to a broader audience. Users can enjoy the game with a friend or challenge themselves against a computer opponent.

4. Scalability and Extendability: The modular structure of the code makes it easy to scale and extend the project with additional features or improvements in the future.

5. Visual Appeal: The use of visual effects and a clean design not only makes the game visually appealing but also demonstrates the importance of aesthetics in user interfaces.
